# Cipher Creator

## Description
A cipher generator that creates a password consisting of 8 upto 128 alphanumeric &amp; special characters, depending on the users choice.
<br>
<br>
Cleaned up the code structure for better readability and maintainability.
I refactored arrays for special characters, numeric characters, lowercase characters, and uppercase characters for clarity and created an options object to hold these character arrays.
<br>
<br>
Refactored the password generation logic to make it more user-friendly.then I hanged the method of getting password options to allow for a clearer understanding.
Having alerts and logs messages if the user inputs are not valid.
<br>
<br>
Integrated a dark mode toggle button without creating a separate page for user preference, and added styles for a more aesthetic appearance.
